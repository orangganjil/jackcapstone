<p>In the summer of 2020 I had gotten intensely bored so I decided to grab my brother’s microscope which was made for kids. I took out the package of pre-made slides he had and brought them and the microscope into my room. I studied the list of things it contained and one of them was a sample of human blood cells. I found that slide in the box and took it out. I turned on the microscope, put the slide onto the stage, and looked into the eyepiece lense. I was amazed at what I saw, and decided to look at all the slides the next day. The next day came and I loved it! I was looking at the slides for hours and I did research as I studied them. I learned so, so much and from that day forward I was hooked!</p>
<p>Later that summer I decided to buy a better microscope and see what I could do. I loved it! I used it so much and continue to use it today. That one boring day during the pandemic is what taught me to love research, science and studying microbes.</p>
<p>Along with microbiology, another thing I love to do is travel! Just last summer I spent a week in France with my family. It was excellent! I got to see so many cool things and I thoroughly enjoyed the culture. I’ve gone to many other places both inside and outside the states. I have visited Colorado, Hawaii, North Dakota, South Carolina, and many other states. Other countries I have visited include, of course, France, but also Canada and Portugal.</p>
<p>I am currently not working a job, but I hope to later next year. Though, I’ve volunteered at places like my church, a homeless shelter, and some other places as well.</p>
